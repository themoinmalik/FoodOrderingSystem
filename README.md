# FoodOrderingSystem


Food Ordering System
Developed a full-stack food ordering application as a skill showcase, leveraging Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Maven for backend development. Implemented JWT and OAuth for secure authentication, and integrated API Gateway, Eureka Discovery Server, and React.js for the frontend. The project highlighted my ability to design scalable microservices and RESTful APIs, demonstrating end-to-end ownership and technical proficiency.
